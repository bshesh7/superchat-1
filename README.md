Superchat for SE 

(Both client and server are missing spellCheck cpp and h files need to add them!)

# Client
The client folder is for client side files.
Go to the client folder and type make to compile all the files.

# Server
The server folder is for server side files.
Go to the server folder and type make to compile all the files.

# Basefiles
This contains all the .cpp and .h files except makefiles for both client and server.
There is no real need for this folder, except for backup purposes.
